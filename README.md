# Yassir Hackathon: Sentiment Analysis Platform

This repository contains the code and resources for the project developed during the Yassir AI Hackathon. Our team tackled the challenge of **sentiment analysis** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to classify customer feedback and assist Yassir in selecting and managing restaurant partnerships for their delivery service.

## Overview

Our solution includes:
1. An NLP-based sentiment analysis model achieving **93% accuracy**.
2. A platform for efficient restaurant referencing, integrating our sentiment analysis model.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- **notebooks/**: Contains Jupyter notebooks used for data analysis, model development, and evaluation.
- **yassir-hackathon_frontend/**: The frontend of the platform, built using **Next.js**.
- **yassir-hackathon_backend/**: The backend of the platform, implemented using **Django Rest Framework**.

## Features

### Sentiment Analysis Model
- Developed using Python and NLP libraries.
- Preprocessed customer feedback data from social media.
- Classified feedback into positive or negative sentiments with high accuracy.

### Platform
- **Frontend**: Interactive user interface for visualizing restaurant data and sentiment analysis results.
- **Backend**: RESTful API for managing data flow between the sentiment analysis model and the frontend.
